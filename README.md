# React Native Playlist Reanimated

I tried to clone Spotify's playlist screen with reanimated. The playlist is mine, if you liked the playlist content here is the playlist.

[Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EpjkVvtHAtmpC?si=b0d576a616854f71)

## Installation

Use yarn to install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Then

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Usage

- Get Spotify Access Token from here: [Link](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist/?playlist_id=&market=&fields=&additional_types=)

- Update the .env file with the access token you retrieved and the playlist id of your choosing.

- Run the app.
